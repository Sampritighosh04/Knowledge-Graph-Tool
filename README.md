# Knowledge-Graph-Tool
This project focuses on automatically generating knowledge graphs from text and PDF documents using NLP and ML techniques. It leverages spaCy for Named Entity Recognition (NER) to detect entities and a Random Forest Classifier with TF-IDF features to predict relationships. The extracted entities and relationships are modeled as nodes and edges using NetworkX, and visualized interactively with Pyvis. A Streamlit-based interface allows users to upload files, view extracted text, and explore the knowledge graph in real time. The system provides outputs as an interactive HTML graph and within the app itself for better usability. Deliverables include source code, a small training dataset, and detailed documentation for setup and usage. Future enhancements will focus on improving relationship accuracy with larger datasets, exploring deep learning models, and supporting additional file formats like DOCX and HTML.
